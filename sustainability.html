<h1>SUSTAINABILITY</h1>
<h2>RESPONSIBLE CAPITAL. LONG-TERM VALUE.</h2>

<p>
At Wentworth Holdings, sustainability is not separate from investment performance—it is
a critical component of long-term value creation. We believe that environmental,
social, and governance factors can materially affect risk, resilience, and returns
across market cycles.
</p>

<h3>Environmental Perspective</h3>
<p>
We consider how businesses manage their environmental impact, including resource
efficiency, emissions, and exposure to regulatory or transition risk. Companies that
adapt thoughtfully to a changing world are, in our view, better positioned to sustain
cash flows and protect shareholder value over time.
</p>

<h3>Social Responsibility</h3>
<p>
Sustainable performance requires more than strong balance sheets; it requires strong
cultures. We look at how companies treat employees, customers, and communities, as well
as how they manage safety, inclusion, and long-term stakeholder relationships.
Organizations that invest in people tend to build more durable franchises.
</p>

<h3>Governance &amp; Alignment</h3>
<p>
Governance is the backbone of sustainability. We favor companies with transparent
disclosure, rational capital allocation, and leadership teams whose incentives are
aligned with long-term shareholders. Sound governance reduces the risk of permanent
capital impairment and supports consistent decision-making.
</p>

<h3>Our Commitment</h3>
<p>
As stewards of capital, we seek partners and investments that reflect a responsible,
long-term mindset. We do not view ESG as a label, but as one lens among many through
which we evaluate durability, risk, and opportunity. Our goal is to help clients
compound wealth in a way that is both financially sound and socially responsible.
