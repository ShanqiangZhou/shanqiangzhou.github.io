<h1>MARKET COMMENTARY</h1>
<h2>GLOBAL MARKETS. LOCAL INSIGHTS.</h2>

<p><strong>Market Commentary – January 2025</strong></p>

<p>
The market landscape entering 2025 is defined by a delicate balance between opportunity
and uncertainty. While inflation continues to trend downward globally, the path of
monetary policy remains uneven across regions, creating pockets of volatility and
mispricing.
</p>

<p>
In the United States, resilient consumer spending and a stable labor market have reduced
expectations for aggressive rate cuts. Equity valuations, particularly in technology and
select consumer sectors, remain elevated and increasingly sensitive to earnings revisions.
We expect dispersion to widen, favoring disciplined, bottom-up stock selection over broad
market exposure.
</p>

<p>
In Japan, structural shifts—including corporate governance reforms, improving return on
equity, and a gradual normalization of monetary policy—continue to attract global capital.
However, the strength of the yen and the timing of BOJ policy adjustments remain key
variables that could affect earnings momentum and foreign investor flows.
</p>

<p>
China’s markets face a more complex backdrop, driven by uneven consumer confidence and
ongoing adjustments in the property sector. Selective opportunities exist in
high-quality exporters, automation, and industries aligned with long-term national
priorities, but broad macro headwinds warrant caution.
</p>

<p>
Across global markets, liquidity conditions are improving, but investors should remain
mindful of geopolitical risks, supply-chain realignments, and the durability of corporate
earnings in a slower-growth environment.
</p>

<p>
At Wentworth Holdings, we continue to emphasize businesses with pricing power, strong
balance sheets, and resilient cash flows—companies capable of generating value across
multiple economic cycles. In a world filled with noise, clarity and discipline remain our
greatest advantages.
