<h1>SHAREHOLDER LETTERS</h1>
<h2>REFLECTION. DISCIPLINE. PARTNERSHIP.</h2>

<h3>Shareholder Letter – 2025</h3>

<p>
To Our Partners,
</p>

<p>
The past year has reminded us that markets rarely move in straight lines. They swing
between optimism and fear, often faster than fundamentals can change. But at Wentworth
Holdings, we measure progress not by quarterly price movements, but by whether the
intrinsic value of our holdings grows over time.
</p>

<p>
We remain committed to a simple philosophy: <strong>own outstanding businesses, avoid
permanent loss, and let time do the heavy lifting.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Throughout 2024, we focused on high-quality companies with durable economics—strong
balance sheets, resilient cash flows, and management teams that allocate capital
rationally. While markets experienced periods of volatility, our portfolio companies
continued to strengthen their competitive positions, reinforce their moats, and improve
their long-term earnings power.
</p>

<p>
Discipline remains our greatest advantage. We do not chase trends, react to noise, or
attempt to predict every macro event. Instead, we concentrate on understanding businesses
deeply, valuing them independently, and acting only when the probability of a favorable
outcome outweighs the risks.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward, we see both challenges and opportunities. Inflation is moderating but
still present, global growth is uneven, and geopolitical uncertainties persist. Yet
history shows that periods of dislocation often sow the seeds of exceptional returns for
investors willing to stay patient, rational, and selective.
</p>

<p>
Our commitment to you is unchanged: We will continue to invest with integrity, caution,
and conviction. We will remain transparent in our decisions and steadfast in our
philosophy. And above all, we will prioritize the preservation and compounding of your
capital over short-term performance comparisons.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for your trust and partnership. We look forward to navigating the years ahead—
together, with clarity and purpose.
</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
<strong>Wentworth Holdings</strong>
