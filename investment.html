<h1>INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY</h1>
<h2>DISCIPLINE. QUALITY. PATIENCE.</h2>

<p>
At Wentworth Holdings, our investment philosophy is grounded in three core principles:
quality, discipline, and patience. We focus on businesses with durable competitive
advantages, resilient cash flows, and management teams that allocate capital with clarity
and integrity.
</p>

<p>
We are valuation-driven investors. We do not chase momentum or market narratives; instead,
we seek opportunities where price diverges meaningfully from intrinsic value. This
requires independent thinking, a willingness to be patient, and the courage to look wrong
in the short term in order to be right over the long term.
</p>

<p>
Risk, in our view, is not defined by short-term volatility, but by the permanent loss of
capital. We aim to protect capital first, then compound it steadily through cycles. This
means avoiding complexity we cannot underwrite, leverage we cannot justify, and situations
where we do not fully understand how we could be wrong.
</p>

<p>
Our objective is simple: to deliver attractive, risk-adjusted returns over time, measured
not in days or quarters, but in years and decades. We believe that by staying disciplined,
thinking long term, and aligning our decisions with our clients' interests, we can build
enduring value through all phases of the market.
