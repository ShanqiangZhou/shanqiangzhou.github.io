<h1>RESEARCH & INSIGHTS</h1>

<h2>Market Overview – A World Defined by Liquidity and Regime Shifts</h2>
<p>
Financial markets today are shaped less by short-term headlines and more by long-term regime transitions:
aging demographics, shifting monetary structures, global supply reconfiguration, and the rise of
intangible capital. At Wentworth Holdings, our research focuses on understanding these structural
drivers rather than predicting short-term volatility.
</p>

<h2>Japan: A Market Rediscovering Itself</h2>
<p>
Japan remains one of the most compelling investment landscapes globally. Corporate governance reforms,
rising wages, improving domestic demand, and a breakaway from decades of deflation are setting the
foundation for a prolonged equity re-rating.
</p>

<h2>The Rise of Global Consumer Franchises</h2>
<p>
Sanrio exemplifies a cultural franchise with multigenerational emotional value. Brands with global
recognition and recurring relevance tend to outperform market cycles—especially when guided by strong
capital discipline and international expansion.
</p>

<h2>Innovation & Asymmetric Assets</h2>
<p>
Certain sectors, particularly those at the frontier of digital transformation, offer asymmetric return
profiles. Metaplanet represents a category where market narratives lag behind fundamental optionality.
Our research emphasizes identifying nonlinear upside rather than forecasting short-term movements.
</p>

<h2>Investment Framework – How We Form Conviction</h2>
<p><strong>1. Fundamentals Over Forecasts</strong><br>
We analyze unit economics, capital allocation, management integrity, and durability of demand.
</p>

<p><strong>2. Behavior Over Noise</strong><br>
Markets misprice assets due to emotional overreaction. We focus on value hiding in periods of uncertainty.
</p>

<p><strong>3. Time Arbitrage</strong><br>
Most participants operate on short cycles. We operate on a multi-year horizon where true compounders shine.
</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>
We continue to see strong opportunities in Japanese consumer brands, innovation-led companies, and
businesses with pricing power and improving capital efficiency.
