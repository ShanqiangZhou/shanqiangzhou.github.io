<h1>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</h1>
<h2>OVERSIGHT. ALIGNMENT. RESPONSIBILITY.</h2>

<p>
At Wentworth Holdings, corporate governance is not a formality; it is a core part of how
we protect capital and build long-term value. Clear oversight, aligned incentives, and
disciplined risk management are embedded in every level of our decision-making.
</p>

<h3>Board Oversight</h3>
<p>
Our governance framework is anchored by an independent, oversight-driven structure.
Strategic decisions, risk appetite, and key investment policies are reviewed with a focus
on long-term outcomes rather than short-term optics.
</p>

<h3>Alignment &amp; Accountability</h3>
<p>
We believe incentives should be directly linked to long-term performance and prudent
risk-taking. Capital allocation, portfolio construction, and risk decisions are evaluated
against clear objectives, and results are reviewed with transparency and accountability.
</p>

<h3>Risk Management &amp; Controls</h3>
<p>
Risk is assessed not only at the position level, but across portfolios and strategies.
We monitor liquidity, concentration, counterparty exposure, and scenario outcomes to
understand how portfolios may behave under stress, not just under base-case assumptions.
</p>

<h3>Stewardship &amp; Responsibility</h3>
<p>
We view ourselves as stewards of capital. This means exercising judgment with care,
communicating honestly about risk and return, and maintaining the discipline to say “no”
when opportunities do not meet our standards.
