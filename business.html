<h1>BUSINESS DIVISIONS</h1>
<h2>FOCUSED MANDATES. ONE PHILOSOPHY.</h2>

<p>
Wentworth Holdings is organized into focused investment divisions, each built around
a disciplined process and a clearly defined mandate. Together, these divisions allow us
to allocate capital efficiently across opportunities while maintaining a consistent
philosophy and risk framework.
</p>

<h3>Public Equity Strategies</h3>
<p>
Our Public Equity Strategies division focuses on listed companies with attractive
risk–reward profiles. We seek high-quality businesses trading at a discount to intrinsic
value, with an emphasis on cash-flow durability, balance-sheet strength, and management
alignment. Portfolios are concentrated and benchmark-agnostic, reflecting our
highest-conviction ideas.
</p>

<h3>Long-Term Holdings</h3>
<p>
The Long-Term Holdings division is dedicated to compounders—businesses we believe can grow
intrinsic value steadily over many years. We are prepared to hold through cycles, provided
fundamentals remain intact and capital allocation remains rational. This division reflects
our belief that time in outstanding businesses is more powerful than timing the market.
</p>

<h3>Tactical Opportunities</h3>
<p>
Our Tactical Opportunities division targets mispriced or event-driven situations,
including dislocations, structural changes, and special situations where the market has
overreacted or misinterpreted risk. While position sizes are controlled, these
opportunities can enhance overall portfolio returns when pursued with discipline and
downside protection.
</p>

<h3>Research &amp; Strategy</h3>
<p>
Underpinning every division is our Research &amp; Strategy group, which provides deep
fundamental analysis, macro context, and scenario work. This team ensures that insights
are shared across strategies, that risks are viewed holistically, and that capital is
deployed where the probability-adjusted return is most compelling.
